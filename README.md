# FederalReserve
Python exploratory data analysis of Federal Reserve time series data on inflation and changes in real GDP.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND & INSPIRATION:
I was reading The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis by Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. In chapter 2, Bernanke talks about the legacy of some important Fed chairmen. He discusses how Paul Volcker aggressively used contractionary monetary policy to address the issue of growing inflation. Volcker succeeded at taming inflation but also helped push the U.S. economy into a recession. Alan Greenspan succeeded Paul Volcker as chairman of the Fed. According to Bernanke, during Greenspan's term, the U.S. economy experienced a major decrease in volatility. Bernanke uses time series plots of percent change in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) to substantiate his claims. Bernanke points out that the standard deviation of the series during Greenspan's term is much lower than that from Volcker's term. I decided to verify Bernanke's claim by performing my own time series analysis. His analysis also inspired me to monitor important macroeconomic variables and identify how they change based on who serves as head of the Federal Reserve.
